          <h3>Freelance Translator</h3>
          <p>I have lived and worked in the People's Republic of China for about 6 years in different fields, and I ventured into freelance translation - Chinese < > English, since 2019; started from helping out at the International Students Office at my school – first as a multilingual translation checker, then as an in-house translator, and now as a freelance translator.<br> My commitment has never faltered, and I was lucky enough to develop my specialisms later on through tutoring programming (图形化编程) to little adorable Chinese humans in the local language, supervised by local teachers who gave their utmost support and expert guidance until I was ready to go it all by myself.<br>
            I see translation as a craft in itself. I firmly believe we should continue to learn and hone our skills throughout our careers.</p>
